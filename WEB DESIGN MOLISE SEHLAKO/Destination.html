                <p>Maletsunyane Falls is a 192-metre-high (630 ft) waterfall in the Southern African country Lesotho.[1] It is located near the town of Semonkong (Site of smoke), which also is named after the falls.[2] The waterfall is on the Maletsunyane River and it falls from a ledge of Triassic-Jurassic basalt.

                The plunging water creates a reverberating echo when it contact the basin of the falls, and local legend has it that the sound comes from the wailing of people who have drowned in the falls.</p>

                <p>The Katse Dam, a concrete arch dam on the Malibamat'so River in Lesotho, is Africa's second largest double-curvature arch dam after the Tekezé Dam in Ethiopia. Located just below the confluence of the Bokong River, which forms the western arm of the Katse reservoir, the dam is part of a larger project which will eventually include five large dams in remote rural areas.</p>

                <p>Tsehlanyane National Park is only one of two national parks in Lesotho, and makes up an intergral part of the greater Maloti/Drankensberg Transfrontier Park.

                The park is located deep in the front range of the Maluti Mountains at the foot of the Holomo Pass and only about 45 minutes on a good road from the South African border post of Caledonspoort (Caledonspoort is 15 minutes drive from the popular Freestate town of Clarens and about 4 hours from Johannesburg international airport).

                The park is reached by a good 32 km-access road that leaves the main Lesotho A1 route, 5 km south west of Butha Buthe. The route passes through the village of Khabo's and parallels the Hlotse River along a very picturesque valley until it reaches the park entrance.</p>

                <p>The Liphofung “place of the eland” cave occupies an important place in Lesotho history. This is the smallest of the LHDA reserves at about 4 hectares. The cave is, in fact, a large sandstone overhang, which is a typical feature of the Lesotho lowlands region.

                Originally used by the San and other Stone Age people, the walls contain important rock art and a rich archaeological deposit of Stone Age implements. Later, King Moshoeshoe “the Great” used the cave as a stopover when visiting that part of the kingdom.</p>

                <p>The Ha Kome Caves are one of the most curious places you can visit in Lesotho and have been classified as a World Heritage Site. These caves consist of five cave houses made of mud built inside a large cavern. Kome Caves are also known as Komaisa Caves or “the great caves”.</p>
